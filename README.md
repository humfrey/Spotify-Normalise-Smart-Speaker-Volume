# Spotify-Normalize-Smart-Speaker-Volume

## Overview
Spotify-Normalize-Smart-Speaker-Volume is a Node.js application designed to normalize the volume of music playback on smart speakers using Spotify's API, and also using the Sonos when playing via Sonos speakers, which cannot be controlled directly from the Spotify API. The application adjusts the speaker's volume to ensure a consistent listening experience across different tracks, which may have varying loudness levels.

## Prerequisites
- An always-on computer or server running Node
- Spotify Developer account and a registered application with Client ID and Client Secret.
- Sonos Develpoer account and a registered application with Client ID and Client Secret
- An active Spotify Premium subscription (required for volume control via the Spotify API)
